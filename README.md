# Fastspeech 2
UnOfficial PyTorch implementation of [**FastSpeech 2: Fast and High-Quality End-to-End Text to Speech**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.04558). This repo uses the FastSpeech implementation of  [Espnet](https://github.com/espnet/espnet) as a base. In this implementation I tried to replicate the exact paper details but still some modification required for better model, this repo open for any suggestion and improvement. This repo uses Nvidia's tacotron 2 preprocessing for audio pre-processing and [MelGAN](https://github.com/seungwonpark/melgan) as vocoder.

## Demo :  [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rishikksh20/FastSpeech2/blob/master/demo_fastspeech2.ipynb) <br />

## Requirements :
All code written in `Python 3.6.2` .
* Install Pytorch
> Before installing pytorch please check your Cuda version by running following command : 
`nvcc --version`
```
pip install torch torchvision
```
In this repo I have used Pytorch 1.6.0 for `torch.bucketize` feature which is not present in previous versions of PyTorch.


* Installing other requirements :
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

* To use Tensorboard install `tensorboard version 1.14.0` seperatly with supported `tensorflow (1.14.0)`



## For Preprocessing :

`filelists` folder contains MFA (Motreal Force aligner) processed LJSpeech dataset files so you don't need to align text with audio (for extract duration) for LJSpeech dataset.
For other dataset follow instruction [here](https://github.com/ivanvovk/DurIAN#6-how-to-align-your-own-data). For other pre-processing run following command :
```
python .\nvidia_preprocessing.py -d path_of_wavs
```
For finding the min and max of F0 and Energy
```buildoutcfg
python .\compute_statistics.py
```
Update the following in `hparams.py` by min and max of F0 and Energy
```
p_min = Min F0/pitch
p_max = Max F0
e_min = Min energy
e_max = Max energy
```

## For training
```
 python train_fastspeech.py --outdir etc -c configs/default.yaml -n "name"
```

## For inference 
 [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/rishikksh20/FastSpeech2/blob/master/demo_fastspeech2.ipynb) <br />
Currently only phonemes based Synthesis supported.
```
python .\inference.py -c .\configs\default.yaml -p .\checkpoints\first_1\ts_version2_fastspeech_fe9a2c7_7k_steps.pyt --out output --text "ModuleList can be indexed like a regular Python list but modules it contains are properly registered."
```
## For TorchScript Export
```commandline
python export_torchscript.py -c configs/default.yaml -n fastspeech_scrip --outdir etc
```
## Checkpoint and samples:
* Checkpoint find [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Fh7zr8zoTydNpD6hTNBPKUGN_s93Bqrs?usp=sharing)
* For samples check `sample` folder.

## Note
* Coding of this repo is roughly done just to re-produce the paper and experimentation purpose. Needed a code cleanup and opyimization for better use.
* Currently this repo produces good quality audio but still it is in WIP, many improvement needed.
* Loss curve for F0 is quite high.
* I am using raw F0 and energy for train a model, but we can also use normalize F0 and energy for stable training.
* Using `Postnet` for better audio quality.
